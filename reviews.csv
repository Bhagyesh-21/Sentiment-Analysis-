R21DYUND841PL8," Very disappointed",Deshank Chauhan,https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEDFXJLXDXUB6PNTE5ONHKW263EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,1,"October 5, 2019","Its been more than 24 hours and this is not working at all, no cooling.. Very disappointed..",true,false,
R2U6TT8U78D0IY," Reducing a Star 5 to 4 !!",TopCrazyStuffdotCom,https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHBJ43BN66PIVUDTB5T4CXL6FZZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,4,"October 10, 2019","Lets cut short everything as generally people buying 500+ side by side refrigerators have a very good idea of refrigerators and mostly an upgrade from smaller ones.

Pros-
- Less Noise
- Taking less power than my previous 270 ltr fridge ( I can confirm that because on backup power my MCB was tripping and not with this bigger latest fridge)
- Space is huge because of better and simple design, even the icebox is not fixed, you can place anywhere
- AI mode is supposed to keep the optimum temperature inside and reduce power consumption
- Full covered backside, so no open ugly compressor to be seen
- led light switch on only when doors open, (just like mobile phones), again a power-saving idea
- Nice Sturdy PVC material for inside build and compartments
-
Cons
-Nothing just that the compressor has only 5 years warranty rather than 10 as compared to some other major brands.
but even if the compressor fails after 5 yrs the cost of replacing would be 3-4k which is still a great deal compared to big brands.

And an important point I would like to make and ask is - Is this a rebranded version of 'BPL 564 Frost Free side by side Refrigerator'? as almost everything is the same except the brand logo and back cover. And since I may be the first few to buy on its launch on 29th sep. The reason I said this because in the product video initially It had the same video present in the BPL refrigerator. And now it is replaced with amazonbasics video.

But Yes even if that is the case I am very satisfied with the performance and build quality.

This review is after 10 days of rigorous use. Any surprises I will definitely update this review. Great job Amazon Basics!

Update:

Around a month later there is a problem of water condensation inside refrigerator and less cooling. Raised a complaint but I must agree to some of the service complaints ITS BAD. If the service is so poor in metro cities what about tier 2 cities. One can imagine.

I am still waiting for the issue to be addressed by Amazon basics.",true,false,

No service, installation team does not respond.
Poor communication, call disconnected by executive.
Amazon chat support says they do not support the installation but other team do.
The other team would never reply you .

Suddenly the return period is already started but the fridge not installed yet.
If you touch the fridge without installation person, you will loss the warranty.

Edit: it's 11th Oct and my fridge is not installed yet. Finally applied for refund.

Amazon team really sucks, now they come up with new installation date and that is 5 days more to wait, just to open the box and plug it.

While I knew the dimensions of the fridge before ordering, when it arrived, it was bigger than what I had imagined. Well, it had to be, it is 564 litres. My previous fridge was about 425 litres and this is definitely an upgrade.

It looks great and seems to be working well. Since it has been just one day, can't comment much on the performance.

Reduced one star because of the installation person & the manual that came with the fridge. The installation person (there actually isn't much to be installed) was not knowledgeable. He did not know the function of the AI button. On being asked, he said that if the button is pressed, the freezer too turns into a refrigerator. So, basically both sides can be used for cooling & there will be no freezer. I found it very strange and the little wisdom that I possess told me that AI is usually Artificial Intelligence. This turned out to be true when I opened the manual.Now the issue is that the manual too has mistakes and the language is poor. I could not understand the function of AI button clearly even after reading the manual.

In short, a good looking machine, which has loads of space and runs silently. Rest of the performance parameters will only be known over a period of time. People who come to install should be better trained and should not misguide customers.",true,false,

Looks great and working fine.
I call it a pure lucky product as i faced no issues with the working of the fridge.
I mentioned lucky because, after sales service for amazonbasics products is totally worthless.
In case something goes wrong, don't even think of their help.
I was trying to call the tollfree number from past two days for installation as mentioned in description (as it is a fridge, no installation is required).
No one pickedup the call, which got disconnected after waiting for 6min and horrible support from amazon, they are no way related to amazonbasics.

AS OF NOW PRODUCT IS AWESOME FOR THE PRICE I HAVE PAID AND A LITTLE TENSED ABOUT CLAIMING WARRANTY IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG IN FUTURE WITH UNSUPPORTIVE AMAZONBASICS TEAM.

Finally someone from samsung (they mentioned amazon has hired them for installation at my home town) have come after 14 days for installation which is not required though.

No doubt. It is worth the money. It is 3 days since I have received the product.
But in the long run only we may know its recurring power consumption cost.
Though there was not much to really install, we waited till the next day for the Technician to do the job. He said that he does not know much about this model fridge since it is a new launch. He was also in the dark about the Energy Star Rating. But he was kind enough to call me today to tell me to watch the video of the product and said that it is mentioned in the video that it is 4 star. Yes, in the video it clearly says but how far it is true, I don't know as it is not mentioned either in the manual nor sticker fixed on the fridge.
He, however, did not know about AI function too but it was clear in the manual. If you set at AI, it will automatically set at - 18°c for Freezer and 5°c (4°c) for Fridge. I tried that and it is working.
The shocker is Alarm. The manual says that if by mistake the doors of the fridge are kept opened for more 2 minutes, it will give alarm and would stop after 10 minutes. I did the test but it was not giving any Alarm! I tried couple of times more but it was not functioning. I called up Amazon care and they too have no clue. So, they have arranged for the Technician to visit our place on 9th Oct, the earliest available date due to pooja holidays, to check for the same as they also say, as per manual, it should give alarm. So, wait for the further update on this.
The Technician did arrive, ofcourse, after lot of follow up which I didn't expect. He also was wondering as to why there was no alarm even after keeping the door open for about 5 minutes. While going closer to close the door, there was a very feeble noice which gives 3 beeps. That's all. To hear that again you have to affix your ear to the door (in which case there is no need for this very, very feeble alarm). 🤔🙃
Hence, one star is reduced because of this, poor service and energy rating not mentioned on the product. Any case we decided to keep as we got it for 39 k with 5 k Amazon cash back. In effect, it costs 34k. That way it was worth the money.

The measurements of the fridge has been removed in their production description above now and wonder why they have removed it! However, I am mentioning it here for your ready reference: Height is 70 inches, Depth is 25.5 inches and width is 36.5 inches.

Otherwise, it is working fine and we had fallen in love with it at the first sight! ☺

Manufactured by Hi-Sense and I must say the operation is very silent. You can barely hear any noise coming from the fridge which is in sharp contrast to my 9 year old fridge. Space is excellent, provided you use the freezer portion. Overall very happy with the product. Cooling is great. Temperature can be adjusted, LED light is super bright. Needs a stabilizer, same is mentioned on the fridge.

Alarm function is there if door kept open for long time, I think maybe a couple of mins. Water dispenser is provided as well for people who like to drink cold water right from the fridge. Fridge can be moved very easily as it has 4 wheels but lifting could be a challenge as it is very heavy. Back side is completely closed unlike other brands

Space is more than adequate for a moderately large family needs. I wish the frozen section to be having a little lesser space because of our needs, hopefully makers will take a note of this and provide different configurations for the frozen section.
After using the fridge for a week, I can say that cooling is really good. Water dispenser is a great feature to have, because you don't have to open the fridge door for water which actually keeps the power bills down. It's huge and silent.

The issue is with delivery as the item arrived with a dent. Although it isn't big but it clearly seems it was caused due to poor handling of the item. I chose not to return as what mattered to me was that the refrigerator should work fine. So I did not wait for installation as it was fairly simple. I with the help of my brother and father I was able to set it up and switched it on and set the temp to max freeze and max cooling. I started to get worried as freezer was starting to cool better by each hour but the progress was slow on the refrigerator section. So then I left it for 6 hrs and even after that the cooling was not optimal. But then I did some research and found out that I should give it 24 hrs so I did. And in the morning both the refrigerator as well as freezer were cooling and freezing at their best. So it was all about giving it time. Water dispenser works effortlessly. The modes are simple to understand and operate. After that morning I set the mode to AI and the temp is set to save electricity as well as provide sufficient cooling in both the sections of the fridge. Although I have not yet used the ice cube box but I know it will work fine as well because the freezer does get real cool in no time when switched to super freeze mode. The shelf is glass so gives you premium feeling. The sides and back get warm so would recommend to put the refrigerator in such a place where people especially kids do not get access to sides or back of refrigerator easily. Overall the fir and finish is superb. Only thing that stopped me from giving 5 star is the dent. I didn't want to go through the hassle of return and replacement thus chose to ignore but this could have been avoided easliy with extra care. Rest the refrigerator is best bang for your buck as it has ample storage for a family of 5-7 and has premium looks along with features.,true,false,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616N0gr6FgL.jpg

I can see the current rating of the product is out of frustration for the product being not installed and pathetic customer service. I was lucky enough to have the product delivered and installed on the same day.

Though the Team who came to install the product had no idea about the touch controls, they setup the internal shelves very well.

Coming to the refrigerator, this is my first side by side refrigerator. So I don’t know how one is expected to work. The left part of the fridge is a freezer and the right one is a normal fridge. It’s a frost free refrigerator, so no ice forming in the freezer part. Maybe because of this functionality, the freezer part is a bit moist/wet (but not leaking) whenever I checked.

The cooking is absolutely fine. The freezer is freezing everything into ice and the normal refrigerator is doing it’s job. The touch controls are pretty straight forward (ice -> left & wind -> right).

There’s an AI mode to adjust temperatures automatically. All it does is override manual setting to a predefined temperatures. It doesn’t adjust to room temperature.

Finally, it’s from Amazon Basics. We wouldn’t know how this brand’s products work unless we use them because they are offering products at a very low cost which makes one think if this will work and if it does for how long. I went ahead and took the risk. Let’s see! Pros and cons time!

Pros:
1. Value for money (if it continues to work)
2. Solid Material and build
3. Simple controls
4. Efficient cooling
5. Has wheels (which will be locked after installation) for moving.

Cons: (Updated)
1. Huge product. Difficult to carry it up the building. Added a picture for comparison with 260 Ltr normal refrigerator.
2. High ceiling required to unbox this inside home as the box has to be removed by moving it straight up or the whole package has to be bent and then the box can be removed in an angle. This requires at least 4-5 people.
3. Slight chances of finger(s) getting stuck while closing doors. Look out for that!

1)Product developed issues within 3 weeks of purchase! Fridge started water leakage near the top right section (close to led lamp). I dont mean more condensation that frost free fridge develops after power cuts, this is actual fully formed water droplets.
2) Loud crackling sounds in the freezer section shortly after the water issue was detected. Similar to electrical wiring sparkling- needs further investigation.

Raised issue with AmazonBasics customer support, will update once inspected.
